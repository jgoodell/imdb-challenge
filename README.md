# Introduction
Written in Python 3 this repository contains the code to mee the requirements of the coding challenge below.

## Challenge
The following is an IMDB movie dataset available via Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset/data.
 
The column names in this dataset should be more or less self-descriptive. Some of the key columns that pertain to this mini-project are: ‘actor_1_name’, ‘actor_2_name’, ‘actor_3_name’, ‘director_name’, ‘budget’ and ‘gross’. You can make assumptions about these names as you see fit in case they do not seem descriptive enough.
 
The task requires the following:
Import the file into a local db
Then write functions in python to perform the following computations on this dataset. (Feel free to use pandas for this purpose):
Compute the top 10 genres in decreasing order by their profitability. Note: You could compute profitability as simply as:
‘gross’ - ’budget’ or
(‘gross’ - ‘budget’)/’budget’
Anything advanced that you can think of
Return the top 10 actors or directors in decreasing order by their profitability (use any definition you choose for profitability using the above guidance).
Bonus questions (Note: If you choose to do any of the bonus questions below, any one question is more than adequate):
Choice 1: Find the best actor, director pairs (up to 10) that have the highest IMDB_ratings, if there are indeed any such pairs.
Choice 2: Any interesting questions that you would like to work on if you would  (for e.g. imdb_score, actor facebook_likes
Choice 3: Build a REST API to return an actor’s information (simple text output)
Write tests for your functions.
Commit code to a git repo (gitlab or github) and send us a link to it.
Also document your steps, libraries used and any instructions.
